        drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and produced
        in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Breaking Bad is the story of Walter White, a struggling
        high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer
        at the beginning of the series. He turns to a life of crime, producing and
        selling methamphetamine, in order to secure his family''s financial future
        before he dies, teaming with his former student, Jesse Pinkman. Heavily serialized,

        corners and has been labeled a contemporary western by its creator.","popularity":"27.4343975493607","poster_path":"/iRDNn9EHKuBhGa77UBteazvsZa1.jpg","seasons":[{"air_date":"2009-02-17","poster_path":"/AngNuUbXSciwLnUXtdOBHqphxNr.jpg","season_number":0},{"air_date":"2008-01-19","poster_path":"/dHCYpEoHEjAV6Xt3eyNthkdLRl3.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2009-03-08","poster_path":"/rCdISteF1GPvPsy0a5L0LDffjtP.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"2010-03-21","poster_path":"/rINvcsYHUprsx9L8zNr5JltALda.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"2011-07-17","poster_path":"/ngnE7FFQqrrLgK3yVsv3kjwtQMZ.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":"2012-07-15","poster_path":"/ih1JKNxEzW56azeFpEQmdu4poA4.jpg","season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","vote_average":8.9,"vote_count":37,"credits":{"cast":[{"character":"Walter
